# Counselling-Website
This is a web project that uses HTML and CSS to create a website for a counselling center. 
It uses simple designs and easy navigation to target the intended users.
It was developed by Trev, Joel, Minna and me while taking the Advanced Web Development class.

## 1. First set up the project as follows:
Download the zipped folder and unzip it OR clone the repository to your local machine

## 2. Look for a file named "index.html" and open it in the browser

## 3. Use that page to navigate through the website
